Speed Maths deluxe is a game about doing basic arithmetic as quickly as possible. It uses Google’s “Digital ink recognition” API which is a part of their ML Kit to detect the numbers the user writes with their finger.

How to play:
Once you press play, a timer will count down from 3. After this you will be presented with a screen with 3 main elements. From top to bottom you will find the equation to solve (along with the next equation and a timer), the window for you to write your answer and a button for you to clear the window if you make a mistake. The equation will not change until you get the question right. Try and complete all of the questions as fast as possible to win.

For fractional answers, be sure to use 'x/y' notation.

Changing the game settings:
There are a multitude of things you can change in order to make equations to your specific desire. You can change:

    • How many questions there are in each round.
    • The range of numbers that are in the equations e.g. allowing only the numbers 1-10.
    • You can turn the sound for the game on and off.

Each high score (quickest time) is saved depending on the configuration specified e.g. If you set a high score with 10 questions and then do the same game but with 5 questions they will have different high scores.
